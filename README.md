# Vector-Sorting
The assignment was to sort large vectors using numerous sorting techniques

Issues/Concerns during the project:

While I was working on the project, part 1 of step 2 has given me the most troubles. 
Mergesort and heapsort were relatively simpler in comparison to quicksort. 
Quicksort ended up giving me the most problems. 
One of the reasons were because of how I was interating through a for loop, which messed up the greater than comparison. 
After fixing that and getting quicksort and the other functions to run properly on my system, on submission, gradescope was giving me issues on Quicksort. 
A lot of my time was spent on finding out what the problem was, but I eventually got to it.
